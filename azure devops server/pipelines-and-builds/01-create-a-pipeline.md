10. Edit the pipeline yam to create three task (as scripts)

   - yarn install

   - yarn lint

   - yarn build

     ```yaml
     # This sets trigger to any update in master  
     # trigger:
     # - master
     
     #  Defines the host for agent (MS hosted)
     pool:
       vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
     
     #  Build steps for the pipeline
     steps:
     - script: yarn 
       displayName: 'Installing node modules'
     
     - script: yarn lint
       displayName: 'Checking for lint errors'
     
     - script: |
         yarn build
       displayName: 'Running webpack build'
     
     # Save artifacts to refer them in release builds
     - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
       inputs:
         path: $(Agent.BuildDirectory)/s/build
         artifact: react-static-website-build-artifacts
     ```
     
     
   
11. Select the yaml path in repository, this will be saved in repo on commit

Define work directory for all steps : https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vsts-docs/issues/6315



12. Click on save and run, choose to commit changes in master branch



**Publishing artifacts**

- To be able to deploy the bundled resources (e.g. to Azure Storage), we will need to retain and share the results (files) of this build with release build 

- Lets instruct the azure to save the result of our build aka **Pipeline Artifacts**

- Add following task to the pipeline.yml

  ```yaml
      # Save artifacts to refer them in release builds
      - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
        inputs:
          path: $(Agent.BuildDirectory)/s/projects/react-static-website/build
          artifact: react-static-website-build-artifacts
  ```

- Now after the build is run, open the build result, we will see an option to view/download artifacts : 

  ![image-20191110115958567](images/download-artifacts.png)







### Create release pipeline

- Go to release tab and click on **New Pipeline**
- ![image-20191110154011530](images/create-release-pipeline.png)





- Click on **Artifacts | + Add** to select artifacts that will be deployed in this build

- **Choose the build from dropdown** to get the artifacts from

  ![image-20191110154310776](images/choose-artifacts-build-create-release-pipeline.png)

	


- Click on add and now we will see the build pipeline as :

### Configure Auto Deployment of artifacts from master branch

- Go back to pipelines tab to continue editing the release pipeline

- Click on **trigger icon** over the artifacts:
